    - Added 'figure' or 'section' when refering to them to avoid confusion.
    - Fixed pages that have many whitespace because of latex layout.
    - Fixed wording in Challenge Test section where the confusion between the previous solution and new one.
    - Bibliography apparently will stay as it is with Papers and Websites at the same time since I did not find anyother way to do it.
